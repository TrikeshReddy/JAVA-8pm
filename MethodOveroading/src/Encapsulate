abstract methods:
a method with only signature and no implementation is considered as abstract method 

concrete methods:
Concrete methods are methods that 
are declared in an abstract class and are implemented in the subclass. They define a set of operations that can be performed on any object of the subclass.

Encapsulation:
Encapsulation is a way 
to restrict the direct access to 
some components of an object.

variables of parent class
extends is the keyword for inheriting one class from another class


method overriding:
method over ride means it already
 had an implementation 
and we are overriding we use @Override

we cannot over ride a static method

Polymorphism:
it means multiple forms for a single method

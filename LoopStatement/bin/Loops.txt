loops:

if we want to execute a peice of code multiple 
time will be going with loops

while,do-while,for

while:

while(condition){
//block of code you want to execute
}

for(intialize;check the condition;increment/decrement){
{
//block of code you want to execute
}
intialize will happen only once during the start of loop execution
condition check will happen for every iteration at the start
increment//decrement will happen for every iteration during the end of the loop body


continue:refers to skip the particular iteration
break:refers to the end of the loop and exiting out of the loop


DeBugging:
we will be using it in a scenario where in you want to see the line by line execution changes in a variable

print vs println
print:
it prints the data and the cursor will remain in the same line
println:
it prints the data and at the end of printing it moves to a new line


Q1)write a java program to print numbers from 0-99(for loop)
Q2)write a java program to print numbers from 0-99 which has 5 in the end
output:5,15,25,35,45,65,55,75,85,95
Q3)write a java program to print numbers from 0-65 which are even

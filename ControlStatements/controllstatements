Switch:
syntax:
switch (key) {
case value:
	
	break;

default:
	break;
}
based on key it will check for values in case and executes that case if it matches with the key

default
if none the case values matches with the key then default will be executed

break:
it differentiates one case from another,if we dont use break the next case also executes even if it doesn't match with the key
